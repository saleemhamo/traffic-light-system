# Traffic Light Control System

Welcome to the Traffic Light Control System project, an innovative solution designed to revolutionize urban traffic management across the UK. Our system intelligently optimizes traffic flow and enhances pedestrian safety using cutting-edge technology, all powered by a Raspberry Pi. By analyzing real-time traffic and pedestrian data, we dynamically adjust traffic signals to reduce waiting times and improve the overall safety of road intersections.

This project is a blend of hardware (HW) and software (SW) components, working harmoniously to bring about a seamless traffic management experience soon to be deployed.

## Project Components

### Hardware

The heart of our system lies in its carefully designed circuitry and the selection of equipment:

- **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as the central processing unit of our traffic control system.
- **Sensors**: For real-time traffic and pedestrian demand detection.
- **Signal Lights**: To visually communicate with traffic participants.

For a detailed overview of the circuit design and equipment, please refer to our [Wiki page on hardware setup](https://github.com/saleemhamo/traffic-light-system/wiki/Page-%233:-Implementation-Details#31-hardware-setup).

### Software

Our software is developed with efficiency and scalability in mind, featuring:

- **Dynamic Signal Adjustment Algorithms**: To process data from various sensors and adjust traffic lights accordingly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: For easy system setup and monitoring.

The complete software architecture and design document can be found in our [GitHub Wiki](<DESIGN_DOCUMENT_LINK>) under the [Design Document section](https://github.com/saleemhamo/traffic-light-system/wiki/Page-%232:-Design-Document).
