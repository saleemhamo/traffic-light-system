# Traffic Light Control System

This project aims to develop a smart traffic light control system to optimize traffic flow and pedestrian safety using a Raspberry Pi. The system dynamically adjusts traffic light signals based on real-time traffic and pedestrian demand, reducing wait times and improving road safety.

## Features

- Real-time traffic detection
- Dynamic traffic light control
- Pedestrian crossing optimization
- Easy deployment on Raspberry Pi
