# Traffic Light Control System

This project aims to develop a smart traffic light control system to optimize traffic flow and pedestrian safety using a Raspberry Pi. The system dynamically adjusts traffic light signals based on real-time traffic and pedestrian demand, reducing wait times and improving road safety.

## Features

- Real-time traffic detection
- Dynamic traffic light control
- Pedestrian crossing optimization
- Easy deployment on Raspberry Pi

## Dependencies

This project requires the following:

- **Doxygen**: Utilized for generating the project documentation. Ensure that Doxygen is installed and correctly set up on your system for documentation generation. More information can be found at [Doxygen's official website](http://www.doxygen.nl/).

- **Boost Libraries**: These libraries are used for added functionality, especially for system and file operations. Ensure that the Boost libraries are installed and properly configured in your environment. Visit the [Boost official website](https://www.boost.org/) for installation and usage instructions.
