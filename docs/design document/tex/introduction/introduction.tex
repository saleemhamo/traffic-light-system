\subsection{Project Overview}
TODO \\
The project overview for the Traffic Light Control System, as gleaned from the provided slides, emphasizes developing an advanced, real-time responsive traffic management solution. This initiative addresses the significant amount of time people spend waiting at traffic signals, with an aim to enhance road safety and efficiency. By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), Inter-Process Communication (IPC), MQTT protocol for lightweight network communication, and computer vision via OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi platform, the system seeks to optimize traffic flow and reduce pedestrian waiting times. The proposed solution will provide immediate responses to pedestrian crossing requests, prioritizing safety and traffic efficiency. This project, spearheaded by Team 4 for ENG5220: Real Time Embedded Programming, represents a proactive approach to mitigating road traffic challenges, leveraging data-driven insights and modular design principles for scalable and reliable traffic management.
